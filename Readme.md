## Overview

This project is an implementation of MLOps for a customer satisfaction prediction model. It uses ZenML and MLflow for experiment tracking, model evaluation, and deployment. 

## Features

- **Data Ingestion**: Extract data and transform it into a usable format.
- **Data Cleaning**: Pre-process and clean the data for training.
- [ZenML](https://zenml.io/) Integration: For pipeline creation and management.
- [MLflow](https://mlflow.org/) Integration: For experiment tracking and model deployment.

## Installation and Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MGJillaniMughal/End-to-End-Customer-Satisfaction-Mlops-Project.git
   ```
   
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd End-to-End-Customer-Satisfaction-Mlops-Project
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Ensure MLflow and ZenML are set up correctly.

## Usage

- To run the main pipeline, execute:
  ```bash
  python run_pipeline.py
  ```

- To deploy the model using Streamlit, run:
  ```bash
  streamlit run streamlit_app.py
  ```
